<h1>My emotional portrait</h>
<img src="https://chpic.su/_data/stickers/SmeaGollum/SmeaGollum_014.png" alt="gollum" width="200" height="200">
<ul>
<li>My name is Adriana Sluka</li>
<li>My mood often depends on weather and period of day. Usually I'm not productive at evenings.</li>
<li>I could call myself an extravert, though after some time in company of people I get very tired and need reboot, about a week home alone.</li> 
<li>I also have a cat</li>
<li>Instead of my photo, I decided to post image of my spirit animal.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Hope you enjoyed my emotional portrait C:</h4>
